# Leapper
Simple browser extension using Leap Motion


##Inspiration

Inspiration for this was to build a really cool way to interact with browsers rather than a traditional mouse pad. Leapper can be used across chrome browser on your devices and give you a awesome browsing experience.

##What it does
Leapper is a chrome extension that lets you use Leap Motion to implement basic mouse controls on a web page.

##How I built it
The first part was building Leapper to be more than just a gesture recognition software and use it in web browsing.

##Challenges I ran into
As the Leap motion API provides specific finger tracking and gesture recognition without specific cursor controls, we had to find the right way to map it to a mouse.

##Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Our extension successfully lets the user scroll on the web page and use the point-select functionality.

##What I learned
Some of us had no clue how Leap Motion works and how do we make it work as a browser extension, this hack has taught us to explore everything we can and motivated us to try hack new hardware.

##What's next for Gaitorade
Leapper has a vast development scope with a room for more than one hardware so we will work in developing Leapper 2.0 version compatible with Muse or even Myo bands to incorporate more versatile gestures.
